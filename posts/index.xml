      <description>Here be a sample post with a custom background image. To utilize this &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; just add the following YAML to a post&amp;rsquo;s front matter.
background: /images/filename.png This little bit of YAML makes the assumption that your background image asset is in the /images folder. If you place it somewhere else or are hotlinking from the web, just include the full http(s):// URL. Either way you should have a background image that is tiled.</description>

      <description>Syntax highlighting is a feature that displays source code, in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature facilitates writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.1
Highlighted Code Blocks To modify styling and highlight colors edit /static/css/_sass/_syntax.</description>

      <description>Here are some examples of what a post with images might look like. If you want to display two or three images next to each other responsively use figure with the appropriate class. Each instance of figure is auto-numbered and displayed in the caption.
Figures (for images or video) One Up   Morning Fog Emerging From Trees by A Guy Taking Pictures, on Flickr.  Two Up Apply the half class like so to display two images side by side that share the same caption.</description>
